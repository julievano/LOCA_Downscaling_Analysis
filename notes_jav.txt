Generally, just reminders I used when setting everything up.  Includes basic commands and also how I set up the env.  Just to have as reference.

commands:

du -sh
ln -s <path> <shortcut>
ls -a --> displays all dot files
git push origin (update my fork, not joes)
(not sure why this isn't currently working, it just hang )

set up env:

1. folked this: 
https://github.com/jhamma/portable-environment-public.git

2. cloned:
git clone https://github.com/julievano/portable-environment-public.git p

3. went to setup file
p/setup/

4. ran setup file
bash setup

5. when running script it asks for: 
Please Input the current SITE [main]

I entered:
/glade/u/home/jvano/ (but it appears that Joe entered ucar)

though expect isn't right.  maybe just a return?

later on:
conda install geopandas
conda install regionmask -c conda-forge



locations of interest:
/glade/u/home/jhamman/projects/loca
scratch:  /glade/scratch/jvano/temp
loca/data_catalog.py is where paths to data and read in commands located
